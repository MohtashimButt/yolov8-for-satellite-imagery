# yolov8-for-satellite-imagery

## Overview
By employing remote sensing techniques for data collection followed by the segmentation of green spaces using a fine-tuned deep learning model we performed a temporal and spatial analysis of green spaces in the F7 sector. To evaluate the model’s geographic transferrability, inference was also performed on images of urban centers in Karachi and Swat, two cities in Pakistan with contrasting urban infrastructure and landscapes.

# Methodology
We fine-tuned Yolov8 instance segmentation model and trained it from scratch on satellite imagery of Islamabad's F-7 sector (coordinates: `33.731318, 73.043857` and `33.710294, 73.070434`). 1240 `.png` tiles (each `256x256`) for the entire sector was generated from [GEID](https://www.allmapsoft.com/geid/) at zoom level `20`. 
- **Dataset-1**: Annotation of around 100 tiles to highlight individual greenspace components (e.g. grass, trees, shrubs, etc).
- **Dataset-2**: 200 images were annotated in a way that greenspace components with overlapping boundaries were merged and labeled as a single greenspace.

We further made augmented versions of each dataset, making 4 version in total.

## How to use our work?
- Clone the repository by using
```
git clone https://github.com/MohtashimButt/yolov8-for-satellite-imagery.git
```
- Open the terminal in the `yolov8-for-satellite-imagery` directory and install `requirements.txt` using the following command:

- Open the `main_segmentation.ipynb` and make sure that you're connected to the GPU.
> The pre-trained weights can be accessed from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AyGqVlN0A6nabeJBpwJ1b81_7bb-izpj?usp=sharing) but if you want to train the model from scratch, follow the steps below:
- Import the desired dataset by uncommenting one of the snippets:

- Once you're done exporting, go to `data.yaml` and change the path `train: your_dataset/train/images`-->`train: ../train/images` and `val: your_dataset/valid/images`-->`val: ../valid/images`
- Run the cell under `Custom Training` with the desired hyperparameters' values.
- Inference steps are self-explanatory in the notebook
