## Overview
By employing remote sensing techniques for data collection followed by the segmentation of green spaces using a fine-tuned deep learning model we performed a temporal and spatial analysis of green spaces in the F7 sector. To evaluate the modelâ€™s geographic transferrability, inference was also performed on images of urban centers in Karachi and Swat, two cities in Pakistan with contrasting urban infrastructure and landscapes.

# Methodology
We fine-tuned Yolov8 instance segmentation model and trained it from scratch on satellite imagery of Islamabad's F-7 sector (coordinates: `33.731318, 73.043857` and `33.710294, 73.070434`). 1240 `.png` tiles (each `256x256`) for the entire sector was generated from [GEID](https://www.allmapsoft.com/geid/) at zoom level `20`. 
- **Dataset-1**: Annotation of around 100 tiles to highlight individual greenspace components (e.g. grass, trees, shrubs, etc).
- **Dataset-2**: 200 images were annotated in a way that greenspace components with overlapping boundaries were merged and labeled as a single greenspace.

We further made augmented versions of each dataset, making 4 version in total as follows:  


Datasets | Training | Validation | Testing | Total |
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
 D1_{aug}      | 339 (80%) | 53 (13%)   | 30 (7%) | 422|
 D1_{non-aug}  | 80 (70%)  | 13 (20%)   | 7 (10%) | 100|
 D2_{aug}      | 339 (80%) | 54 (13%)   | 33 (7%) | 426|
 D2_{non-aug}  | 140 (70%) | 40 (20%)   | 20 (10%)| 200|
